# File Management Exercises

This project contains several exercises demonstrating file operations and data manipulation in TypeScript.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: File Operations

Demonstrates saving data to files with error handling.

- Features:
  - Generic type support for data saving
  - Error handling with detailed messages

  - Sample implementation with person data

### Exercise 2: String Operations

Implements immutable string array sorting functionality.

- Features:
  - Non-mutating array operations
  - Null/undefined handling
  - Empty array support
  - Test coverage for edge cases

### Exercise 3: Stack Documentation

Details two different technology stacks:

- MVP Stack: Focused on rapid development with AWS services
- Production Stack: Emphasizes scalability and monitoring
